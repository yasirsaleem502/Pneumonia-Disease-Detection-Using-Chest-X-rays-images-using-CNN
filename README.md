## Project Overview

This project involves developing a deep-learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging the power of CNNs, this project aims to create an automated tool that assists in the early detection of pneumonia, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses.

## Objectives
-Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-infected or healthy.

-Improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time required for diagnosis.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung that primarily affects the air sacs and can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Chest X-rays are a common diagnostic tool for detecting pneumonia. However, manual interpretation of X-rays requires expertise and can be time-consuming. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images, providing a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool

## Dataset Description

The data set refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories.

The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For the purposes of this project, the features 'Channel' and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Description of Categories

-FRESH:                           annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous)

-MILK:                            annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous)

-GROCERY:                         annual spending (m.u.) on grocery products (Continuous)

-FROZEN:                          annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)

-DETERGENTS_PAPER:                annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)

-DELICATESSEN:                      annual spending (m.u.) on and delicatessen products (Continuous)

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for clustering. Steps include:

-Handling Missing Values: Check for and address any missing values.

-Feature Scaling: Normalize features to ensure they are on the same scale.

-Feature Selection: Use relevant features for clustering.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA helps to understand the data and identify patterns. Key analyses include:

-Distribution Analysis: Examine the distribution of annual income and spending score.

-Correlation Analysis: Investigate relationships between features.

-Visualization: Plot data to identify potential clusters.


# Modelling

## K Means Clustering
K-means clustering is used to partition the data into k clusters. Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar characteristics.

# Model Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of a K-Means Clustering model involves assessing the quality and effectiveness of the clustering results. Since K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm, traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy are not applicable. Instead, we use various techniques to evaluate the clustering results.

Key Evaluation Techniques

-**Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**:

The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares measures the total distance between data points and their corresponding cluster centers. A lower WCSS indicates tighter and more distinct clusters.


-**lbow Method**:

The Elbow Method helps in choosing the optimal number of clusters by plotting WCSS against different values of k. The "elbow" point in the plot indicates the optimal number of clusters.


-**Silhouette Score**:

The Silhouette Score evaluates how well each data point fits within its cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better-defined clusters


-**Cluster Visualization**:

Visualizing the clusters helps in qualitatively assessing the clustering results. By plotting the clusters, you can visually inspect the separation between different clusters and ensure they are well-formed

# Reasult

After running K-Means Clustering, the dataset is segmented into distinct clusters. Each cluster represents a customer segment with similar spending behaviors and income levels.
